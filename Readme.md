# Minicube-Splitter

Collection of scripts to split the minicubes into cross-validation folds

### Usage

````julia
julia cluster_cubes.jl
````

When running the script, all dependencies will be installed automatically through `Pkg.instantiate`, just run the program with a recent Julia version. Currently the script assumes that the minicube registry is stored in the same folder as the script and it will write the groups into a `./results/` folder. 

You can download the registry with `get_registry.jl`. Please adjust the paths as necessary.
